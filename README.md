# Regular Expression Form Validation

This project demonstrates a simple user signup form with real-time validation using JavaScript and regular expressions (RegEx).

## Getting Started

To use this form validation in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/regex-form-validation.git
   ```

2. Open the HTML file in your web browser or integrate it into your project.

3. Include the JavaScript validation script in your project.

4. Customize the form fields and validation patterns as needed for your application.

## Usage

- **Username**: Must contain 5 - 12 alphanumeric characters.
- **Email**: Must be a valid email address.
- **Password**: Must be 8 - 20 characters and can include letters, numbers, '@', '_', and '-'.
- **Telephone**: Must be a valid Indian telephone number with 11 digits.
- **Profile Slug**: Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and be 8 - 20 characters.

## Example

```html
<!-- Include the JavaScript validation script -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="validation.js"></script>

<!-- Sample form fields -->
<form>
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
  <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
  <input type="text" name="telephone" placeholder="Telephone" />
  <input type="text" name="slug" placeholder="Profile Slug" />
</form>
```

## Customization

You can customize the form fields and validation patterns by modifying the JavaScript code in `validation.js`. Update the `patterns` object to match your specific validation requirements.

```javascript
const patterns = {
  // Add your custom validation patterns here
};
```

## Styling

The form is styled using CSS. You can further customize the styles by editing the `styles.css` file in your project.

```

Make sure to replace `https://github.com/your-username/regex-form-validation.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository if you decide to host your code there. This README provides an overview of your project, instructions for usage, and customization options.
